function [intersects, edgeIndices] = intersectLinePolygon(line, poly, varargin)
%INTERSECTLINEPOLYGON Intersection points between a line and a polygon
%
%   P = intersectLinePolygon(LINE, POLY)
%   Returns the intersection points of the lines LINE with polygon POLY. 
%   LINE is a 1-by-4 row vector containing parametric representation of the
%   line (in the format [x0 y0 dx dy], see the function 'createLine' for
%   details). 
%   POLY is a NV-by-2 array containing coordinates of the polygon vertices
%   P is a K-by-2 array containing the coordinates of the K intersection
%   points.
%
%   P = intersectLinePolygon(LINE, POLY, TOL)
%   Specifies the tolerance for geometric tests. Default is 1e-14.
%
%   [P INDS] = intersectLinePolygon(...)
%   Also returns the indices of edges involved in intersections. INDS is a
%   K-by-1 column vector, such that P(i,:) corresponds to intersection of
%   the line with the i-th edge of the polygon. If the intersection occurs
%   at a polygon vertex, the index of only one of the two neighbor edges is
%   returned. 
%   Note that due to numerical approximations, the use of function
%   'isPointOnEdge' may give results not consistent with this function.

%   Examples
%   % compute intersections between a square and an horizontal line
%     poly = [0 0;10 0;10 10;0 10];
%     line = [5 5 1 0];
%     intersectLinePolygon(line, poly)
%     ans =
%           10     5
%            0     5
%     % also return indices of edges
%     [inters inds] = intersectLinePolygon(line, poly)
%     inters =
%           10     5
%            0     5
%     inds =
%           4
%           2
%      
%   % compute intersections between a square and a diagonal line
%     poly = [0 0;10 0;10 10;0 10];
%     line = [5 5 1 1];
%     intersectLinePolygon(line, poly)
%     ans =
%            0     0
%           10    10

%   HISTORY
%   2008-11-24 rename 'pi' as 'intersects', update doc
%   2009-07-23 removed forgotten occurence of 'pi' variable (thanks to Bala
%       Krishnamoorthy)
%   2010-01-26 rewrite using vectorisation
%   2011-05-20 returns unique results
%   2011-07-20 returns intersected edge indices
%   2012-11-22 add 'diag' option for linePosition

% get computation tolerance
