% POLYNOMIALCURVES2D Manipulation of planar smooth curves
%   Polynomial curves are plane curves whose points are defined by a
%   polynomial for each x and y coordinate.
%   A polynomial curve is represented by 3 row vectors:
%   * the bounds of the parametrization
%   * the coefficients for the x coordinate (in increasing degree)
%   * the coefficients for the y coordinate (in increasing degree)
%
%   Example:
%   C = {[0 1], [3 4], [0 1 -1]};
%   represents the curve defined by:
%       x(t) = 3 + 4*t;
%       y(t) = t - t*t;
%   for t belonging to the interval [0 1].
%
%   As each coordinate are given by polynoms, it is possible to compute
%   various parameters like curvature, normal, or the exact geodesic length
%   of the curve.
%
%   For most functions, parameters are given as three separate arguments.
%   Sometimes, only the 2 parameters corresponding to the X and Y
%   coefficients are required.
