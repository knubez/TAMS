% POLYGONS Manipulation of planar polygons and polylines
% Version 1.6 21-Mar-2011 .
%
%   The 'polygons' module contains functions operating on shapes composed
%   of a vertex list, like polygons or polylines.
%
%   We call 'polyline' the curve defined by a series of vertices.
%   A polyline can be either closed or open, depending on whether the last
%   vertex is connected to the first one or not. This can be given as an
%   option is some functions in the module.
%   A 'polygon' is the planar domain delimited by a closed polyline. We
%   sometimes want to consider 'complex polygons', whose boundary is
%   composed of several disjoint domains. The domain defined by a single
%   closed polyline is called 'simple polygon'.
%   We call 'curve' a polyline with many vertices, such that the polyline
%   can be considered as a discrete approximation of a "real" curve.
%
%   A simple polygon or polyline is represented by a N-by-2 array, each row
%   of the array representing the coordinates of a vertex. 
%   Simple polygons are assumed to be closed, so there is no need to repeat
%   the first vertex at the end. 
%   As both polygons and polylines can be represented by a list of vertex
%   coordinates, some functions also consider the vertex list itself. Such
%   functions are prefixed by 'pointSet'. Also, many functions prefixed by
%   'polygon' or 'polyline' works also on the other type of shape.
%
%   For multiple-connected polygons, the different connected boundaries are
%   separated by a row [NaN NaN].
%
%   For some functions, the orientation of the polygon can be relevant: CCW
%   stands for 'Conter-Clockwise' (positive orientation), CW stands for
%   'Clockwise'.
%
%   Polylines are parametrized in the following way:
%   * the i-th vertex is located at position i-1
%   * points of the i-th edge have positions ranging linearly from i-1 to i
%   The parametrization domain for an open polyline is from 0 to Nv-1, and
%   from 0 to Nv for a closed polyline (positions 0 and Nv correspond to
%   the same point).
%
%   Example:
%   % Simple polygon:
%   P1 = [1 1;2 1;2 2;1 2];
%   drawPolygon(P1);
%   axis([0 5 0 5]);
%   % Multiple polygon:
%   P2 = [10 10;40 10;40 40;10 40;NaN NaN;20 20;20 30;30 30;30 20];
%   figure;drawPolygon(P2); axis([0 50 0 50]);
